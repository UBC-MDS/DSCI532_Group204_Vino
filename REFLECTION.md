While creating the app "V is for Vino", we unfortunately could not implement all of the features we had in mind for this version of the app. Due to limitations of data, time, and Altair documentation, the sketch of the app does differ from the actual app, although many of the functionalities remain the same. 

Overall, we were able to answer the wine-related questions we proposed for the initial design of the app, but not to the full extent described prior. For instance, we were able to include both the geographic and wine feature analysis. However, rather than having the geographic and wine feature analyses be interactive, we decided to separate these analyses fully using different tabs. The separation of these analyses is due to lack of documentation for interactive choropleths. In the future we hope to add a clickable element which would display dynamic charts to view the data for each state. It would also be useful for future apps to have table in which the user could filter and retrieve wines that meet a specific criteria. We also could have put histograms for the points and price of the wines to show the distribution based on region, variety, and winery.

The TA offered a number of valid suggestions, all of which had surfaced when talking about the potential functionality of the app. For instance, in newer versions of the app we would like to distinguish between red and white wine. This suggestion was not possible to implement in this version of the app as there are lots of varieties, so it would have taken too much time to correctly categorize all wines in the dataset. We also hope to expand our analyses to other countries in the dataset in newer versions of the app. However, for countries outside the US, there are not many observations and a fair amount of missing data, which led us to discard this data during our initial data wrangling. 

There are a number of things that we thought was done well during app development. For instance, we thought the division of work between group members was fair, and we worked well together. We have a good colour scheme and display that is easy to use and informative. We also have excellent filter and search features, which allow the user to explore the data in depth. Overall, although we were not able to implement everything we had hoped, we are happy with the end-product of this app development.
